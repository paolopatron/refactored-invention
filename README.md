# Application name: refactored-invention
# Developed by: Paolo Patron

# Everyday we pretty much use the same applications, may it be for work or for personal use.
# This python application can be used to pre-load those specific applications at once with a click of a button.
# When you open RunAppsUI.py, you can do the following:
# 1. Select File Path
# 2. Run All Apps
# 3. Reset
# Selected file paths are saved in a file called defaultapps.txt for reference later when the app is run again.

# Update logs:
# 1. A reset function was added if we want to start over.
# 2. A separate RunAppsCmd.py was created to automatically run applications that were defined in the defaultapps.txt. No UI needed.

# Credits to people from YouTube which I used as reference to create this application.
# Hope this helps!
